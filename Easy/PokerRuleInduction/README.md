My solutions to some of Kaggle Machine Learning competitions. The repository contains 3 sections that divides the problems to 3 difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) according to the difficulty i faced during understanding or implementing the problem solution.

Python packages used:

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
